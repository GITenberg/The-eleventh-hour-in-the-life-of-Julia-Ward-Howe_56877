<h2>AD MATREM</h2>

<p>The acorns are again ripe on your oaks, the leaves of your nut tree
begin to turn gold, the fruit trees you planted a lustre since, droop
with their weight of crimson fruit, the little grey squirrels leap
nimbly from bough to bough busily preparing for winter’s siege. The air
is fragrant with the perfume of wild grape, joyous with the voices of
children passing to the white school house on the hill. The earth laughs
with the joy of the harvest. What thank offering can I bring for this
year that has not yet taught me how to live without you? Only this sheaf
of gleanings from your fields!</p>

<p>This slight and hasty account of some of my mother’s later activities
was written to read to a small group of friends with whom I wished to
share the lesson of the Eleventh Hour of a life filled to the end with
the joy of toil. More than one of my hearers asked me to print what I
had read them, in the belief that it would be of value to that larger
circle of her friends, the public. Such a request could not be
refused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_1" id="page_1">{1}</a></span></p>

<p>My mother’s diary for 1906, her eighty-seventh year, opens with this
entry:</p>

<p>“I pray for many things this year. For myself, I ask continued health of
mind and body, work, useful, honorable and as remunerative as it shall
please God to send. For my dear family, work of the same description
with comfortable wages, faith in God, and love to each other. For my
country, that she may keep her high promise to mankind, for Christendom,
that it may become more Christlike, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> the struggling nationalities,
that they may attain to justice and peace.”</p>

<p>Not vain the prayer! Health of mind and body was granted, work, useful,
honorable, if not very remunerative, was hers that year and nearly five
years more, for she lived to be ninety-one and a half years old. When
Death came and took her, he found her still at work. Hers the fate of
the happy warrior who falls in thick of battle, his harness on his back.</p>

<p>How did she do it?</p>

<p>Hardly a day passes that I am not asked the question!</p>

<p>Shortly before her death, she spoke of the time when she would no longer
be with us&mdash;an almost unheard-of thing for her to do. We turned the
subject, begged her not to dwell on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes!” she laughed with the old flash that has kindled a thousand
audiences, “it’s not my business to think about dying, it’s my business
to think about living!”</p>

<p>This thinking about living, this tremendous vitality had much to do with
her long service, for the important thing of course was not that she
lived ninety-one years, but that she worked for more than ninety-one
years, never became a cumberer of the earth, paid her scot till the
last. She never knew the pathos of doing old-age work, such as is
provided in every class for those inveterate workers to whom labor is as
necessary as bread or breath. The old ploughman sits by the wayside
breaking stones to mend the road others shall travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> over; the old
prima donna listens to her pupils’ triumphs; the old statesman gives
after-dinner speeches, or makes himself a nuisance by speaking or
writing, <i>ex cathedra</i>, on any question that needs airing, whether it is
his subject or not; she did good, vigorous work till the end, in her own
chosen callings of poet and orator. What she produced in her last year
was as good in quality as any other year’s output. The artist in her
never stopped growing; indeed, her latest work has a lucidity, a robust
simplicity, that some of the earlier writings lack.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1909 she was asked to write a poem on Fulton for the
Fulton-Hudson celebration. Ever better than her word, she not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span>
wrote the poem, but recited it in the New York Metropolitan Opera House
on the evening of September 9th. Those who saw her, the only woman amid
that great gathering of representative men from all over the world, will
not forget the breathless silence of that vast audience as she came
forward, leaning on her son’s arm, and read the opening lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A river flashing like a gem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with a mountain diadem,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">or the thunders of applause that followed the last lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While pledge of Love’s assured control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Flag of Freedom crowns the pole.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poem had given her a good deal of trouble, the last couplet in
especial. The morning of the celebration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> when I went into Mrs. Seth
Low’s spare bedroom to wake her, she cried out:</p>

<p>“I have got my last verse!”</p>

<p>She was much distressed that the poem appeared in Collier’s without the
amended closing lines. The fault was mine; I had arranged with the
editor Mr. Hapgood for its publication. She had done so much “free
gratis” work all her life that it seemed fitting this poem should at
least earn her, her travelling expenses.</p>

<p>“Let this be a lesson,” she said, “never print a poem or a speech till
it has been delivered; always give the eleventh hour its chance!”</p>

<p>It may be interesting here to recall that the Atlantic Monthly paid her
five dollars for the Battle Hymn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> the Republic, the only money she
ever received for it.</p>

<p>Her power of keeping abreast of the times is felt in the Fulton poem,
where she rounds out her eulogy of Fulton’s invention of the steamboat
with a tribute to Peary. Only a few days before the news of our latest
arctic triumph had flashed round the world, her world, whose business
was her business as long as she lived in it; so into the fabric of the
poem in honor of Fulton, she weaves an allusion to this new victory.</p>

<p>On her ninety-first birthday a reporter from a Boston paper asked her
for a motto for the women of America. She was sitting on the little
balcony outside her town house, reading her Greek Testament, when the
young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> was announced. She closed her book, thought for a moment,
then gave the motto that so well expressed herself:</p>

<p>“Up to date!”</p>

<p>Was there ever anything more characteristic?</p>

<p>In December, 1909, the last December she was to see, she wrote a poem
called “The Capitol,” for the first meeting of the American Academy of
Arts and Letters at Washington. The poem, published in the Century
Magazine for March, 1910, is as good as any she ever wrote, with one
exception&mdash;the Battle Hymn; and that, as she has told us, “wrote
itself.” She had arranged to go to Washington to read her poem before
the Association. Though we feared the winter journey for her, she was so
bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span> on going that I very reluctantly agreed to accompany her. A
telegram, signed by William Dean Howells, Robert Underwood Johnson, and
Thomas Nelson Page, all officers of the Association, urging her not to
take the risk of so long a journey in winter, induced her to give up the
trip. She was rather nettled by the kindly hint and flashed out:</p>

<p>“Hah! they think that I am too old, but there’s a little ginger left in
the old blue jar!”</p>

<p>She never thought of herself as old, therefore she never was really old
in the essentials. Her iron will, her indomitable spirit, held her frail
body to its duty till the very end.</p>

<p>“Life is like a cup of tea, the sugar is all at the bottom!” she cried
one day. This was the very truth; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> knew no “winter of discontent.”
Her autumn was all Indian summer, glorious with crimson leaves, purple
and gold sunsets.</p>

<p>In April, 1910, she wrote the third and last of her poems to her beloved
friend and “Minister” James Freeman Clarke. She read this poem twice, at
the centenary celebration of Mr. Clarke’s birth held at the Church of
the Disciples, April 3rd, and the day after at the Arlington St. Church.
Compared with the verses written for Mr. Clarke’s fiftieth birthday and
with those celebrating his seventieth birthday, this latest poem is to
me the best. The opening lines bite right into the heart of the matter;
as she read them standing in the pulpit a thrill passed through the
congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> of her fellow disciples gathered together in memory of
their founder.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">Than he doth from God receive.<br /></span>

<p>The poem on Abraham Lincoln written for the Lincoln Centenary and read
by her at the meeting in Symphony Hall, Boston, February<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> 12th, 1909, is
perhaps the best of the innumerable memorial poems she composed. As one
by one the centenaries of this and that member of the band of great men
and women who made our country illustrious in the 19th Century were
celebrated, it came to be considered as a matter of course that she,
almost the last survivor of that noble company, should write a poem for
the occasion. So difficult a critic as Professor Barrett Wendell said to
me that he considered some of the stanzas of the Lincoln poem as good as
the Battle Hymn. I remember he particularly liked the last two verses,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A treacherous shot, a sob of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A martyr’s palm upon his breast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where blameless souls of heroes meet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, thrilling through unmeasured days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song of gratitude and praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cry that all the earth shall heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God, who gave him for our need.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>During her last summer she was in correspondence with her friend Mr.
Garrison about the publication of a volume that should gather up into
one sheaf these scattered occasional poems. She had this much on her
mind and made every endeavor to collect the poems together: some of them
had never been printed, and of others she possessed no copy. She stopped
in Boston on her way to Smith College in the last days of last
September, and spent an afternoon in her Beacon St. house looking for
some of those lost poems. Her wish was fulfilled, and the posthumous
volume, to which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> gave the title “At Sunset,” lies beside me. Look
down the page of contents and note how various are the names that figure
in the list of personal poems, and what a wide range of character they
show; beginning with Lincoln, Doctor Holmes, Washington Allston, Robert
E. Lee, Whittier, Lucy Stone, Phillips Brooks, Robert Browning,
Archbishop Williams, and ending with Michael Anagnos&mdash;this is a wide
swath to cut, wide as her own sympathy.</p>

<p>One poem of hers that has soothed many a wounded heart should be better
known than I believe it to be. Though it has no dedication, it might
well be dedicated to the men and women who have tried, and who to the
world seem to have tried in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>On the 26th of July, 1908, she wrote: “The thought came to me that if
God only looked upon me, I should become radiant like a star.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>
thought is embodied in the following quatrain.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou on me but turn thy wondrous sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My breast would be so flooded by thy light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light whose language is immortal song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I to all the ages should belong.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Two lines of hers have always seemed to me to express above all others
her life’s philosophy:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the house of labor best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can I build the house of rest!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Of all her labors, heavy and varied as those of Hercules, her poetry was
what she loved best. But she lived in an age when there are few who can
take their spiritual meat in verse. The age of steel is an age of prose,
and so she labored in season and out to give her message in prose as
well as in poetry, with the spoken word as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> well as the written. She was
the most willing of troubadours; she hastened gladly wherever she was
called, whether it was to some stately banquet of the muses like the
Bryant Centenary, or to a humble company of illiterate negroes, in the
poor little chapel at Santo Domingo, where she preached all one season.
Whether some rich and powerful association like the Woman’s Club at
Chicago summoned her or some modest group of working women on Cape Cod,
she was always ready. She asked no fee, but accepted what was given her.
She spoke and wrote oftenest for love, and next often for an honorarium
of five dollars. The first need of her being was to give. So much had
been given to her that she was forever trying to pay the debt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> giving
of her store to others. I find in her own handwriting the best
expression of this need of giving, that was perhaps the prime necessity
of her life.</p>

<p>“I, for one, feel that my indebtedness grows with my years. And it
occurred to me the other day that when I should depart from this earthly
scene, “God’s poor Debtor” might be the fittest inscription for my
gravestone, if I should have one. So much have I received from the great
Giver, so little have I been able to return.”</p>

<p>One day a rash scatter-brained fellow who was always getting himself and
others into hot water asked her this question:</p>

<p>“Is it not always our duty to sacrifice ourselves for others?”</p>

<p>She knew very well that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> contemplating a perfectly reckless step
and was trying to hoodwink her&mdash;and himself&mdash;into thinking the action
noble, because it would be so disadvantageous to himself. The boy I fear
forgot her answer; here it is for you to remember and lay to heart.</p>

<p>“We must always remember that we come into the world alone, that we go
out of the world alone, that there is nothing to us but ourselves.”</p>

<p>Certain things, she held, we must sacrifice, selfish personal ends,
comfort, pleasure, ease, but if we are to fight the good fight we must
not make the fancied sacrifice of letting our arms rust while we lay
them down to fight another’s battle&mdash;nine times out of ten an easier
thing to do than to fight our own. She had met with so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> much opposition
all her life through serving the unpopular causes of Abolition, Woman’s
Suffrage, Religious Freedom, she had fought so grimly for what, when she
entered the ranks, always seemed a Forlorn Hope, that she knew the real
joy lies in the battle, not in the victory.</p>

<p>Her last public appearance in Boston was at a hearing in the State
House, where she came to plead for the cause of pure milk. This was on
the 23rd of May, 1910, four days before her ninety-first birthday. There
had been a great deal about the Pure Milk Crusade in the newspapers, the
Boston Journal had made a special question of it and one of the
reporters had already interviewed her on the subject. The Chairman of
the Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> Milk Consumer’s Association had asked her to give her
name as honorary president of the league. This she was glad to do, but
this was not enough, she wanted to do more. I was called up once or
twice on the ’phone and asked if I thought Mrs. Howe was able to speak
before the legislative committee at one of the hearings. I thought that
with the birthday festivities so near and the fatigue of moving down to
Newport before her, this would be a little too much, and consequently
“begged off.” In these days there was a meeting in Cambridge in memory
of Margaret Fuller. She was invited to be present, and was determined to
go.</p>

<p>“They have not asked me to speak,” she said more than once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course they will ask you when they see you,” I assured her.</p>

<p>“I have my poem on Margaret written for her Centenary,” she said.</p>

<p>“Take it with you,” I advised. “Of course you will be asked to say
something, and then you will have your poem in your pocket and be all
prepared.”</p>

<p>I was unable to go with her to the meeting, a young lady who came to
read aloud to her going in my place. They came back late in the
afternoon; the meeting had been long and I saw immediately that she was
very tired. The cause of this soon appeared.</p>

<p>“They did not ask me to speak,” she said, “and I was the only person
present who had known Margaret and remembered her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>”</p>

<p>I was deeply troubled about this. I saw that she had been hurt, and I
knew that if I had gone to the meeting I could have managed to let it be
known that she had brought her poem to read. For a very little time she
was a good deal depressed by the incident&mdash;felt she was out of the race,
no longer entered on the card for the running.</p>

<p>Very soon after this they telephoned me that there would be another
hearing on the milk question at half past ten, and that it would
probably go on all the morning. She had been very bright when she came
down to breakfast and made a capital meal. When I went into her room, I
found her at her desk all ready for the day’s campaign, though I knew
that the Margaret Fuller incident still rankled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s to be a hearing at the State House on the milk question; they
want you dreadfully to speak.”</p>

<p>She was all alert and full of interest in a moment.</p>

<p>“What do you say, shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Give me half an hour!”</p>

<p>I left her for that half hour. When I returned she had sketched out her
speech and dressed herself in her best flowered silk cloak and her new
lilac satin and lace hood&mdash;a birthday gift from a poor seamstress. We
drove to the State House together, and after some difficulty in finding
the right lift finally reached the room where the hearing was going on.
She had made these notes for her speech, but had not brought them with
her; we found them afterward in her desk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems to me that the theme of this hearing is one which should
commend itself to all good citizens. I think that even our patient
American public is tired of the delay, for although we are in many ways
a happy people, I do think that our public is a long suffering one. I
should think that we might hope for a speedy settlement. For we are not
discussing points of taste and pleasure, but matters of life and death.
There are various parties concerned in the desired settlement, but to my
mind the party most nearly concerned is the infant who comes into this
world relying upon a promise which we are bound to fulfil, the promise
that he shall at least enjoy the conditions of life. I learn from men of
science that no possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> substitute exists for good milk in the rearing
of infants. How can we then delay the action which shall secure it?”</p>

<p>She listened to the long speeches with interest, little realizing that
this was to be her last public appearance in Boston. When the time came
for her to speak, it was noticed that while all the others took the oath
upon the Bible to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, the ceremony was omitted with her. As her name was called she
rose and stepped forward leaning on my arm.</p>

<p>“You may remain seated, Mrs. Howe,” said the Chairman.</p>

<p>“I prefer to stand,” was the answer. So, standing in the place where,
year after year, she had stood to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> for the full rights of
citizenship, for the right to vote, she made her last thrilling appeal
for justice. Her keen wit, her power of hitting the nail on the head,
were never used to better purpose. The hearing had been long and
tedious. There had been many speeches, the farmers who produce the milk,
the dealers who sell it, worthy citizens who were trying to improve the
quality of the milk supply, experts whose testimony showed the far from
ideal conditions under which the milk of the great city is brought to
its consumers. Everything had been proper, commonplace, prosaic, deadly
dull. Her speech was short and to the point, giving in a few words the
whole crux of the matter. Her presence, the presence of the old Sybil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span>
mother, grandmother, great-grandmother was extraordinarily romantic, it
lifted the whole occasion out of the realm of the commonplace into that
of the poetic. Her speech followed in substance the notes she had
prepared, but it was enhanced with touches of eloquence such as this:</p>

<p>“We have heard a great deal about the farmers’ and the dealers’ side of
this case. We want the matter settled on the ground of justice and
mercy; it ought not to take long to settle what is just to all parties:
justice to all! Let us stand on that. There is one deeply interested
party however, of whom we have heard nothing. He cannot speak for
himself, I am here to speak for him, the infant!”</p>

<p>The impression made was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> overwhelming. This ancient Norn, grave and
beautiful as the elder Fate, claiming Justice for the infant in the
cradle! The effect upon the audience was electrical. The roughest
“hayseed” in the chamber “sat up;” the meanest dealer was moved, the
sleepiest legislator awoke. The silence in that place of creaking
chairs, and coughing citizens, was amazing. All listened as to a
prophetess as, step by step, she unfolded the case of the infant as
against farmer and dealer. When Mr. Arthur Dehon Hill, the Counsel for
the Association, led her from the room he said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Howe, you have scored our first point.”</p>

<p>The friend, who had called in her help, was one of the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span>
“Anti-Suffragists.” This was a very characteristic happening. Whenever
any great question of public interest, not connected with Woman
Suffrage, came up, the “antis” were continually coming to ask her help.
If the cause was a good one she always gave it. She was no respecter of
persons; the cause was the thing. Over and over again she was appealed
to by those who were moving heaven and earth to oppose her in Suffrage,
to help some of their lesser ends. She was always ready; always hitched
her rope to their mired wagon and helped pull with a will. Her wagon was
hitched to a star, the force celestial in her tow rope was at the
service of all who asked for it in a good cause.</p>

<p>A few days after the State-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> hearing, she fell in her own room and
broke a rib. She recovered from the effects of this and in the last days
of June moved down to her place at Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where she
passed nearly four happy months with children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren about her. Three weeks before her death she wrote to
the Reverend Ada Bowles:</p>

<p>“I have it in mind to write some open letters about Religion and to
publish them in the Woman’s Journal.”</p>

<p>She was at work upon the first of these, a definition of true Religion,
when the end came. Her last Tuesday on earth, she presided at the
Papeterie, a social club of Newport ladies, in whose meetings she
delighted. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> was in splendid vein; that gay company of clever women
gathered around her as pretty butterflies hover about a queen rose,
still fascinated, still entranced by this belle of ninety years. She
wore over her pretty white dress the hood she had received from Brown
University, the year before, when she was given the degree of Doctor of
Literature. She was as usual the central figure at the meeting, and gave
the Club a vivid account of her visit to Smith College, whither she had
gone the week before to receive another degree. The next morning she
worked at her “Definition of True Religion;” five days later, the
summons came. Leaving the task unfinished, as she would have said, “the
iron to cool upon the anvil,” she passed on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> larger task that now
absorbs her ardent spirit.</p>

<p>During her last years she received many letters, even printed documents,
with minute inquiries touching her method of life. A society of
Nonogenarians sent a set of questions about her habits of body, and
mind, with a postscript asking especially to what she attributed her
unusually prolonged activity. Though I am sure she must have answered,
for she was faithful beyond belief in such matters, we have found no
record of her answer. Now she has left us, her children are often asked
the same sort of question about her:</p>

<p>“How did she do it?”</p>

<p>“What was her secret?”</p>

<p>“Why did she die ninety-one years<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> young, instead of ninety-one years
old?”</p>

<p>If she herself had tried to tell you her secret, to account for her rare
powers preserved so late in life, spent so prodigally at an age when the
lean and slippered pantaloon hoards his scant store of strength as a
miser hoards his gold, she would have said something like this:</p>

<p>“You must remember I had a splendid Irish wet-nurse!”</p>

<p>Perhaps she laid too much stress on that excellent woman’s share in
making her all she was (no foster-mother was ever more faithfully
remembered by nursling); she owed something, surely, to her forebears.
She came of good old fighting stock; in her veins thrilled the blood of
Francis Marion, the Swamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span> Fox of Virginia, of General Greene, both
heroes of the Revolution, of that staunch old rebel, Roger Williams, of
the Wards, for two generations colonial Governors of Rhode Island. All
this fighting blood, together with her red hair, gave a certain militant
touch to her character; she was a good fighter for every just cause,
especially the cause of Peace. Though she spoke oftener of the Irish
wet-nurse than of her ancestors, she did not altogether forget them as
an anecdote told by my sister, Mrs. Richards, proves. They were at some
meeting, a religious gathering I think, where one speaker&mdash;rather an
effete pessimist&mdash;closed a speech in the key of the “Everlasting No,”
with the doleful words:</p>

<p>“I feel myself weighed down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> a sense of the sins of my ancestors.”</p>

<p>My mother, who was the next speaker, sprang to her feet with the retort:</p>

<p>“And I feel myself lifted up on the virtues of mine!”</p>

<p>There rang out the key-note of her life, the “Everlasting Yea,” the
trumpet-tone to which all high souls rally.</p>

<p>Many people have had fine wet-nurses; a legion have the same legacy of
power in their blood, who do not accomplish much with it.</p>

<p><i>Poeta nascitur, non fit!</i> She was of course born an uncommon person,
but I believe the manner and habits of her life, quite as much as her
native power, made for her vigorous old age. As I look back on the
intimate compan<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> companionship of a lifetime, I realize that these
excellent life habits, habits that any one of us can cultivate, had even
more to do with her long continued usefulness than the great Irish
wet-nurse herself.</p>

<p>First, and last, and all the time, she worked, and worked, and worked,
steadily as nature works, without rest, without haste. She was never
idle, she was never in a hurry. Though she played too, earnestly,
enthusiastically, it was never idle play; there was always a dash of
poetry in her pastime, whether it was making a charade for the Brain
Club, or composing a nursery rhyme for her grandchildren. The capacity
for work like everything else grows by cultivation. She started life
with a rarely active mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> temperament. So do many people. It was
the habit of study, of concentration, of work, carefully cultivated from
the first, held on to in spite of difficulties&mdash;she had plenty of
them&mdash;that wrought what seemed to some of her contemporaries a miracle.
She could say like Adam in Shakespeare’s play “As You Like It:”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My age is as a lusty winter;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’ll do the service of a younger man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In all your business and necessities.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Let me go with you!” This is what Age is forever saying to Youth. “Do
not leave me behind&mdash;I can still serve!” So long as Age makes good the
claim, heydey, headlong, good-natured Youth lets the veteran march in
its glorious ranks. Youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> does not crowd him out, as the veteran too
often thinks, he drops out because he “cannot keep the pace!” The reason
she did not drop out was because she made good her claim. The children
and grandchildren of those with whom she first enlisted, were content to
have her march with them, still in the van.</p>

<p>Her training, from her very start in life, made her a cosmopolitan; one
of the factors of this world citizenship was her very early study of
foreign languages. French, Italian and Latin she knew almost from the
time she could speak, so that she gathered into her spirit the essence
of the race genius of the Latins. Later came the Teutonic baptism, for
she only learned German at fourteen, when her adored<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> brother, Sam Ward,
came home from Heidelberg, brimming over with the songs, the poetry, the
philosophy of Germany. She studied Schiller and Goethe with ardor&mdash;among
her treasures, we have found a long autograph letter from Goethe to her
tutor, Dr. Cogswell. In her youth there were still cultivated French
people living in New York, who had taken refuge there during the reign
of terror. She remembered one of these gentlemen in exile who gave her
French lessons, another who came to the house when there was a dinner
party to mix the salad, a third who came to dress her hair for a ball.
Then there were a group of Italian political exiles who were made
welcome at her father’s house, and the Greek boy (a fugitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> from the
unspeakable Turk), Christy Evangelides, adopted by him, who till the day
of his death spoke of her as his sister Julia. All these early
influences tended to make a cosmopolitan of the little lady while she
was still in the nursery. The general culture of the “little old New
York” of that time was far broader than that of Boston; the narrow
swaddling bands of Puritan provincialism never bound her free and
vaulting spirit. From world citizenship to universal citizenship, to
other world citizenship is a far cry. There are men and women with a
truly cosmopolitan spirit who never attain that wider universal
citizenship. She often quoted Margaret Fuller’s “I accept the universe.”
Though keenly aware of the manner in which Margaret had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> laid herself
open to ridicule by this high-sounding phrase, without herself
formulating it (her sense of humor could never have allowed that), she
practically did “accept the universe,” was always conscious of a sort of
universal citizenship that made the affairs of every oppressed people
her affairs. No hand, however dirty, was ever stretched out to her that
she did not take it in her own and in taking it recognize the God in the
man. She carried a touchstone in her bosom by which she found gold in
natures that to others seemed trivial and base. She had few intimate
friends, none in the usual sense of the term, for with all her bonhommie
that made her the “friend of all the world,” the Universal Friend was
her only real intimate. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> reserve of soul was impenetrable; only her
poems, and occasionally a page in her diary, give us any insight into
her spiritual nature&mdash;glimpses of a certain high companionship with the
stars and the planets.</p>

<p>We hear much of the dual nature of man. The term misleads. Man, or at
least woman has a triple nature, is made up of flesh, mind and spirit.
How did she use these three different natures&mdash;the physical, the
intellectual, the spiritual?</p>

<p>In her youth the views of health were very different from what they are
now. As a child, she lived the greater part of the year in New York,
where she was never encouraged to take much outdoor air or exercise.
Every afternoon at three o’clock the big yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> and blue family coach,
drawn by two fat horses, came to the door to take the children out for a
drive. Even when they went to the country for a change of air, the
children’s complexions were more considered than their health. Miss
Danforth, an old friend of the family, told my mother in later years of
having met the Wards at the seaside, where Julia, who had a delicate
ivory complexion, wore a thick green worsted veil when she went down to
the beach.</p>

<p>“Little Julia has another freckle today,” the visitor was told. “It was
not her fault, the nurse forgot her veil.”</p>

<p>She was from the first a natural student, loving her books better than
anything else; but she was a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span> normal child too and her good
spirits and her social gifts often tempted her from her work. Her sister
Louisa remembered that she used to make her maid tie her into her chair,
so that she should not be able to leave her study should the temptation
assail her. In spite of a too sedentary youth, she started life with an
uncommonly good body. After her marriage to my father she received many
new and valuable ideas on matters hygienic, and while never a great
pedestrian she always walked twice a day till the very end of her life.
Still it must be confessed that her muscles were the least developed
part of her. For the last twenty years she was rather lame, the result
of a fall, when her knee was badly injured. She was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> persistent
in walking as much as she was able however, in spite of the effort it
cost her. During the summer and autumn, she passed a large part of the
day, studying and reading, on the piazza of her country house at Oak
Glen in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Though for many years she left the housekeeping to the daughter or
granddaughter who was living with her, she always kept her own bank
account and never allowed any one to take charge of her finances. She
often lamented that her hands were so useless for household tasks,
envying her granddaughters’ dexterity with scissors and needle. I must
not forget to mention her practising. She had a beautiful voice which
had been carefully trained in the old Italian method.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> She practised her
scales regularly all her life; I have often heard her say she believed
the exercise of singing was very valuable in preparing her for public
speaking. She was faithful too in practising on the piano, and always
played her scales so that her fingers never lost their flexibility or
the power to do the things she really wanted them to do&mdash;to hold the pen
(she almost never dictated, but wrote everything with her own hand), to
play the piano, to accompany her speaking with appropriate gestures. To
the last her hands retained their exquisite shape; the cast made from
them after death shows their unimpaired beauty. My father was very
strict about diet; all “fried abominations” were taboo with him, pastry,
high seasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> ham, cocoanut cakes&mdash;all rich food&mdash;were anathema
maranatha. From first to last she was frankly a rebel in this matter. It
was said, in the family, that she had the digestion of an ostrich. In
spite of all opposition she calmly continued to eat whatever she fancied
to the end of her life. During her last summer she wrote to her
physician asking permission to eat ham and pastry, dishes that to her
daughters seemed a little heavy for summer weather. At her last luncheon
party she was advised not to eat pâté de foies gras or to drink
champagne; she put aside the advice with the familiar remark we all knew
so well:</p>

<p>“I have taken these things all my life and they have never hurt me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was, she had a perfect digestion which she used
carefully and never abused. She ate moderately and slowly, with an
entire disregard to what is usually considered good for old people. She
rose at seven; in her youth and middle age she took a cold bath, in
later years the bath was tepid&mdash;well or ill, it was never omitted.
During the last twenty years, that great fourth score so rich in
happiness to herself and her family, and that greater family of hers,
the Public, she took a little light wine with her dinner, “for her
stomach’s sake,” as she would say, quoting St. Paul. This, with a cup of
tea for breakfast, was the only stimulant she needed, for her spirits
were so buoyant, her temperament so overflowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> with the <i>joie de
vivre</i>, that we called her the “family champagne.” Breakfast with us was
a social meal; there was always conversation and much laughter for she
came down in the morning with her spirits at their highest level. She
slept about eight hours. Until her seventieth year I never knew her to
lie down in the daytime, unless she was suffering with headache. The
first part of that seventieth year was not a good time for her. More
hearty healthy people are killed every year by the sentence: “The days
of our years are threescore years and ten,” than by any four diseases
you like to name. Even her radiant health, her buoyant temperament felt
its depressing influence; as the weeks and months went by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> she found
herself quite as vigorous in her seventieth year as she had been in her
sixty-ninth, she forgot all about her age and resumed her activities,
retaining under protest the daily nap. She lay down with the clock on
the bed beside her; twenty minutes was quite time enough to “waste in
napping!” During the last five or six years, always grudgingly, she gave
a little more time to resting, taking a half-hour’s siesta before
luncheon, another before dinner, “to rest her back.” She always sat in a
straight backed chair, never in her long life having learned how to
“lounge” in an easy chair. She was by nature a night owl and never
wanted to go to bed if there was any other night owl to keep her
company. So much for her use of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> faithful servant, the body. If the
development of her muscles was not quite up to the modern standard, her
intellectual training far surpassed it. From first to last she kept her
mind in the same state of high training that the athlete keeps his body,
strove for that perfect balance of power in all the different functions
of the brain that an all-round athlete aims for in his physique. I never
remember a time when she relaxed the mental gymnastics that kept her
mind strong, supple, active.</p>

<p>Once, at a crucial moment, when beset by perplexities, I asked for
advice, her answer, stamped on my memory as long as it shall hold
together, was given in three Latin words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Posce fortem animum.</i>” Ask for a strong mind! The motto of her English
friend, Edward Twistleton, known and loved by her generation of
Bostonians.</p>

<p>Ask for a strong mind; ask earnestly enough and you will get it, will
learn to laugh at that old-fashioned bogey, the fear of being considered
“strong-minded.”</p>

<p>Long ago, when a silly acquaintance demanded if it was true she was a
strong-minded woman, she parried with the counter thrust:</p>

<p>“Is it not better to be strong-minded than to be weak-minded?”</p>

<p>If you want a strong mind or a strong body there is only one way to get
it, by faithful exercise. There is no royal road, no easy short cut to
either goal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> The wise friend, the good physician can point out the way,
you yourself must tread it!</p>

<p>She always read her letters and the newspapers (history in the making)
immediately after breakfast. Then came the morning walk, a bout of
calisthenics, or a game of ball; after this she settled to the real
serious business of the day; ten o’clock saw her at her desk. She began
the morning with study, took up the hardest reading she had on hand. In
her youth she read Goethe; in her middle life, when she was deep in the
study of German philosophy, Kant, Fichte or Hegel. For years Kant was
the most intimate companion of her thought. In the early sixties, when
she was in the forties, her diary was filled with Kan<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span>t’s philosophy.
Sometimes she differs with his conclusions, sometimes amplifies them,
oftenest endorses them.</p>

<p>“One chosen lover, one chosen philosopher!” was her motto. While she
owed much to Spinoza and records in her journal that Kant does not do
him justice, her philosopher par excellence was Immanuel Kant. On her
seventieth birthday the Saturday Morning Club of Boston gave her a
beautiful jewel with seven moonstones and one topaz. At a dinner soon
after she wore this jewel to pin a lace scarf. The conversation at table
turned on Kantian philosophy and she was asked some question concerning
it.</p>

<p>“Do you think I wear the Categorical Imperative on my left shoulder?”
she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span></p>

<p>“Is this the Categorical Imperative?” asked Mrs. Whitman, pointing to
the jewel that held the lace. After that the club’s jewel went by the
name of one of the toughest nuts in Kant’s philosophy.</p>

<p>When she was fifty years old she learned Greek; from the time she could
read it fluently, the Greek philosophers, historians, and dramatists
shared with the Germans those precious hours of morning study. In the
end the Hellenes routed the Teutons, and remained her most cherished
intimates. At luncheon she would tell us what she had been studying, an
excellent way to teach children history. I shall never forget the day
when she had read in Xenophon’s Anabasis the account of the retreat of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> Greeks, who formed part of the expedition of Cyrus. She came
dancing into the dining room, where the children were waiting for their
soup, waving her beautiful hands and crying:</p>

<p>“Thalatta! Thalatta!” the cry of the wearied Greeks on first catching
sight of the sea, after wandering for years in the interior of the
Persian empire.</p>

<p>No event in history is quite so real to me as Hannibal’s crossing the
Alps. Day by day she took us with that valiant Carthaginian general on
his long journey across Hispania, over the Pyrenees, through Gaul, along
the Rhone, and over the Graian Alps. The day Hannibal finally got his
elephants over the Little Saint Bernard Pass, and down into Italy, was
one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> positive rejoicing for us little ones. Her imagination was so
keen that when she repeated to us what she had been studying, it always
seemed as if she had seen these things with her own eyes, not merely
read about them. The effort of studying Greek whetted her mind to its
keenest edge. Aristotle and Plato, with her Greek Testament, she read to
the last. She talked with us less about the philosophers than the
dramatists and historians. I remember how much we heard about the Birds
of Aristophanes, one of her favorite classics. Reading Greek was, I
think, the greatest pleasure of her later life. One afternoon last
summer, when a pretty girl of a studious turn came to see her, I chanced
to hear her parting words, said with a fervor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> solemnity that
impressed the young visitor:</p>

<p>“Study Greek, my dear, it’s better than a diamond necklace!”</p>

<p>After the morning plunge into Greek or German philosophy “to tone up her
mind,” she took up whatever literary task she was at work upon, “put the
iron on the anvil,” as her phrase was, “and hammered” at it till
luncheon. She was a most careful and conscientious writer, writing,
rewriting, and “polishing” her work with inexhaustible patience.
Occasionally she got a poem all whole, in one piece, like The Battle
Hymn. This was rare though; as a rule she toiled and moiled over her
manuscripts. In the afternoon she was at her desk again, unless there
was some outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> engagement&mdash;answering letters, reading books in a
lighter vein, Italian poetry, a Spanish play, a book of travels or, best
of all, a good French novel.</p>

<p>Each day opened with the stern drill of the Greek or German philosophy,
by which her mind was exercised and at the same time stored with the
thoughts of the wise, the labors of the good, the prayers of the devout.
That was the first process, the taking in, receiving the wisdom of the
ages. Then came the second or creative process, when she gave out even
as she had received. This regular mental exercise was like a series of
gymnastics, by widen the receptive and creative functions of the brain
were kept in perfect working order. If you are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> <i>pour out</i>, you must
first <i>pour in</i>. If your lamp is to serve as a beacon light, it must be
well trimmed and filled with oil every day.</p>

<p>She never in my memory took up any work after dark. Unless she was
called abroad by some festivity or meeting, the evening was our play
time. She invariably dressed for dinner, which was followed by talk,
whist, music, and reading aloud. She rarely used the precious daylight
for reading English novels, so at night she was ready to listen to some
“rattling good story” recommended by one of the grandchildren. She
delighted in Stevenson, Crawford, Cable, Barrie, Stanley Weyman, Conan
Doyle, Meredith, Tolstoi and Sienkiewicz. How she loved the friends of
bookland, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> friends who never hurt or bore! The new ones were
welcome, but she was faithful to the old and liked nothing better than
to reread those masterpieces of her youth, the novels of Scott, Dickens
and Thackeray. We read Pickwick every year or two; she never wearied of
the greatest English novelist’s greatest masterpiece. A good ghost story
made her flesh creep; she was often kept awake by the troubles of the
“people in the book,” who were so real to her that, when they were
having a very bad time of it, she would spread her hands before her face
and cry out:</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! I cannot endure it!”</p>

<p>Money troubles of hero or heroine especially afflicted her; this was
odd, for she bore the loss of the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> of her own fortune with
courage and equanimity. Though she knew the value of money, and
practised the most touching little economies so that she might have more
to give away, she cared very little about money and was always too busy
with more important matters to think much of it. The stories of arctic
adventure, Jack London’s especially, “gave her the shivers;” she ached
with the cold and hunger of his dogs and heroes. The younger people
among the listeners often envied her enthusiasm. Her imagination was so
keen, her power of making believe the story was real so tantalizing,
infectious too, that it carried us through many a book that would have
been dull without it.</p>

<p>One of the last books she enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> was Dr. Morton Prince’s Dissociation
of a Personality. She was deeply interested in this last word on
psychology and every day at luncheon gave us an account of Sally’s last
prank.</p>

<p>In her later years, though she wrote much poetry, she did not read as
much English verse as in her youth. I do not know at what period she
studied Shakespeare, but she was so familiar with the plays that at the
theatre I have often heard her murmur a correction of a line falsely
given by some player. Her memory was prodigious; it was like a vast
collection of pigeon-holes, where there was a place for everything, and
everything was in its place. She seemed to have a sort of mental
card-catalogue of all the knowledge that was stored away in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>
capacious brain. It was as if the subjects were all classified, and when
she wished to speak, write or think on any given one, she consulted the
catalogue, then went straight to the alcove in that well stored library
and brought forth volume after volume dealing with the subject under
consideration. It will hardly be believed that she wrote her volume of
Reminiscences entirely from memory, never so much as consulting her own
diary. It has been said of her that she remembered all she ever knew,
whereas most of us forget a large part of what we have known. She
certainly had an unusual command of her own knowledge. On one of my long
absences in Europe, I had taken with me by mistake her large Worcester’s
dictionary, thinking it was mine. On my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> return after an absence of more
than two years, I exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How dreadful it was of me to take your dictionary&mdash;what have you
done&mdash;did you buy a new one?”</p>

<p>“I did not know you had taken it,” she said.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;how did you get along without a dictionary?”</p>

<p>She was surprised at the question.</p>

<p>“I never use a word whose meaning I do not know.”</p>

<p>“But the spelling?”</p>

<p>She gave a funny little French gesture of the shoulders, inherited with
so much else from her Huguenot ancestors, of whom she knew little and
thought much. It meant, I suppose:</p>

<p>“When you have learned Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>
Italian, you will have learned how to spell English&mdash;perhaps!”</p>

<p>At sunset, sitting upon her piazza at Oak Glen, her eyes fixed on the
flaming sky beyond her pines, if she chanced to be alone, she would
repeat an ode of Horace. She was learning one, line by line, when the
summons came. I remember her saying that this made the thirtieth ode she
had committed to memory. <i>Nous revenons á nos premiers amours</i>. Horace,
the delight of her youth, consoled what might have been some lonely
hours in her last days.</p>

<p>So much for the regular intellectual drill, by which she kept her mind
delicately keen, as the soldier keeps his weapons for the fight, as the
craftsman keeps the tools for his work. Admirable as this was, it was
only the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> source of her power. What was it fed the inner flame
of her life so that it shone through her face, as fire shines through an
alabaster vase?</p>

<p>She tapped the great life current that flows round the world; to those
who know the trick, ’tis the simplest, most natural thing in the world
to do, as easy as for the babe to draw the milk from its mother’s
breast. You have merely to put yourself “on the circuit,” let the force
universal flow through you, and you can move mountains or bridge oceans.
She knew the trick; she was forever trying to teach it to others, to
women in especial, to working women above all others.</p>

<p>Her first waking act was prayer, aspiration; her last, thanksgiving,
praise! Just as some persons’ first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> action is to open the window and
fill the lungs with fresh air, or to drink a glass of cold water, hers
was to open wide the door of her soul and let the breath of the Spirit
blow through it. She was a mystic, a seer. The Battle Hymn was not the
only poem “given” her in the gray dawn of day when the birds were
singing their matins; many of her best poems, her best thoughts came to
her during the first moments of consciousness, when the Marthas of this
world are wondering what they shall get for breakfast, or what clothes
they shall put on. Poor Martha, dear Martha! Try for the uplift and the
grace&mdash;they will come to you, even if yours is not the art to make a
poem out of them. That is a special gift! Live your poem, and its music
will turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> the lives of those with whom you live from prose to poetry,
change life’s water into wine.</p>

<p>She very rarely talked with her children on religious matters. Both she
and my father had a dread of giving us the very narrow religious
training they themselves had received. Conscious of the mistakes of such
a bringing up, she shunned them and, though we all knew how devout a
person she was, it was chiefly through her writings and her poems that
we received a sense of the religious side of her nature. Her faith in a
divine Providence was the deep well-spring in which the roots of her
being were fixed. She lived in daily communion with the divine life. Her
diary is full of dreams that are like the ecstatic visions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> old
saints. In the note already referred to written on the margin of a poem
in her posthumous volume, At Sunset, she says:</p>

<p>“The thought came to me that if God only looked upon me I should become
radiant like a star.”</p>

<p>Beatrice, her favorite of Shakespeare’s heroines, says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There was a star danced and under that I was born!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In October, the month she left us, a wonderful star appears in the
heavens, and at this season of the year shines with an extraordinary
brilliancy. She always watched for it and often pointed it out to
others.</p>

<p>“What is the name of that star?” I have heard her ask more than one man
of science. “It changes color<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> like a flash light in a light house,
flashes from white to green and then to red.” At last she asked the
question of a man who could answer it and learned that her star’s name
was Aldebaran and that is one of the stars of the constellation of
Taurus. Her horoscope was never cast, but I believe that she was born
under the influence of that wonderful star that flashes first the color
of the diamond, then the ruby, and last the emerald, and that when she
was born, Aldebaran danced!</p>

<p>Though she so rarely spoke of such matters, we who lived with her were
fed at second hand by that deep limpid stream, the river of immortal
life, in which she grew rooted deep. One of the many manifestations of
this was the joyousness with which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> took up each day and its little
cares. She always came into the room in the morning like a child who has
some good news to share with the family. Those wonderful spirits, that
overflowed in every sort of wit, jest and antic, took the sting from the
bitterest nature; in her company the satirist grew kind, the cynic
humane. A deep spiritual joy seemed to enwrap her like a sort of
enveloping climate. Where she was, the sun shone, the sky was blue,
birds sang, brooks babbled, for so tremendous was her spiritual force
that it always conquered. It sometimes seemed to me as if I was
conscious of a sort of war of temperaments between her and some
pessimistic or cynical nature. It was like one of those days when, as we
say, “the sun is trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> come out.” The sun of her presence never
failed to come out, to banish the gray fog of the blues, the sufferings
of the irritable or the disheartened. When people came to talk to her of
their troubles, as they often did, the troubles seemed to shrink like
the clouds on a dark day, leaving first a little peep of blue visible,
and finally the whole sky, clear and fervid.</p>

<p>One word more, take it as a legacy, a keepsake from her. I asked her for
a statement of the ideal aim of life. She paused a moment, then summed
up the mighty matter in one sentence, clear and cosmic as a single
rain-drop, a very epitome of her own life:</p>

<p>“To Learn, To Teach, To Serve, And To Enjoy!”</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
